1. install pyaudio using pipwin - install pipwin normally then use 'pipwin' instead of 'pip' to install pyaudio

2. Have a sleep time between starting the speaker mp3 file in text to speech and deleting the file

3. Other known exceptions are added (but commented) for the recognizer.google(audio) function returned value

4. The text to speech is only used when there is something meaningful to say

5. Added a file storing all possible request and response messages


IDEAS to put later:

1. ask current weather (get live update somehow)

2. when closing app ask for a confirmation reply

3.
